By using the notation of $v(t)$ and $x(t)$ for velocity and position at time $t$ respectively we are recognising that these are functions and therefore can be used to calculate the velocity and/or position at any time so long as we have an initial condition. These conditions are $v_0$ and $x_0$ for initial velocity and position respectively - as we will see in [Lecture 2](Lecture2) the initial conditions terminology relates to how we solve differential equations, but you will see more of these later and in your maths courses."
