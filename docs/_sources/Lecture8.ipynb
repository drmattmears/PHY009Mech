What you will find, if you haven't spotted it already, is that there is generally a rotational counterpart to all of the linear topics we have studied so far.

    "A logical next step will be to consider the total kinetic energy of a rotating body, firstly by examining an individual particle moving on a circular path but then developing this idea to an extended solid body rotating about some axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the individual particle case we use our standard equation for the kinetic energy but note that the velocity is the tangential velocity. A justification for this is that if the centripetal force were to suddenly vanish the particle would move off in a straight line at the tengential velocity and therefore would have kinetic energy $\\frac{1}{1}mv_t^2$. However we now have an relationship between the tangential and angular velocities which allows us to define the kinetic energy of an individual particle moving in a circular path of radius $r_i$ as\n",

    "Let us now move on to the extended solid body case. The way we treat this system is by breaking the single solid body down into the sum of individual particles all rotating about a common axis. It then follows that the total kinetic energy of the solid body is equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of these individual particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In {numref}`fig:C8_energy` I have picked out two specific particles, labelled with subscripts 1 and 2, to highlight the differences. Particle 1 of mass $m_1$ follows a circular path of radius $r_1$ and has tangential velocity $v_1$ whereas particle two has different mass $m_2$, radius $r_2$ and tangential velocity $v_2$. What they **do** have in common is the angular velocity $\\omega$ - the angular velocity must be the same for all particles that make up the solid body if the body were to remain in the same shape and not skew or distort. You'll also note that I have not made the assumption here that the masses of each particle are the same. This allows me to be more general in the subsequent treatments for bodies that have non-uniform densities, although in practice we will usually stick to the uniform case when solving problems in this course.\n",

Taking the simple case where the mass remains constant, i.e. we use $F=ma$ then it is possible to redefine the mass as a measure of resistance to changes in linear motion. In the Second Law equation $m$ is a constant of proportionality and if this constant is larger then a larger force is required to cause the same acceleration (hence being a measure of resistance). \n",

    "The moment of inertia is the rotational analogue; it is the resistance to changes in rotational motion.\n",

    "There is a key difference between mass and moment of inertia. The mass of an object is intrinsic to it, and when we want to accelerate a body of mass $m$ along a straight line it does not matter how this mass is distributed. The same is not true for a rotating body. The resistance to changing the rotational motion of a body depends not only on how much mass the body has but how this mass is distributed **with respect to the axis of rotation**. We will explore this further in a couple of worked examples below and some in your tutorials, but table 9.2 in the core textbook shows the range of geometries we will consider in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we embark on some worked examples we need to make one final adjustment to our definition of the moment of inertia.

    "## Axis theorems for moments of inertia\n",
    "In the real world we often want to calculate the moment of inertia for a body about an axis that does not lend itself to a nice symmetry of mass distribution. You will see this in one of the tutorial questions where we examine in great depth the opening of a swing bin lid.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two theorems that come to our aid, the parallel axis theorem and the perpendicular axis theorem. These are extremely useful as they allow us to translate from rotation about one axis to another axis so long as the new one is either parallel or perpendicular to the first axis. In practice this means we often start with one of the nice symmetric systems and shift our axes to suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we wanted to calculate the moment of inertia of a hula hoop being spun around on your wrist then we can start with the moment of inertia for the hoop through the centre of mass (i.e. the centre of the hoop) and shift the axis by a distance equal to the radius of the hoop.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are able to prove these theorems fairly easily but for the purpose of this course you will not be expected to remember the proofs. The results are worth remembering but knowing how to derive them can be helpful in a pinch if you cannot remember the final equations."
