This force must balance the weight of the particle such that there is no resultant force and therefore no acceleration.  \n",

A key point here is that this force acts normal or perpendicular to the **surface**, and for instances where the surface is at an angle to the horizontal (e.g. in Worked Example 3.4 below) this normal force will not be directed vertically upwards.\n",

    "#### Forces Involving Two Particles Connected by a Light Inextensible String\n",
    "\n",
    "When two moving particles are connected by a light (i.e. massless) and inextensible (i.e. constant length) string, there will be a tension in the string. By Newton's Third Law, the forces acting on the particles due to the tension in the string will have the same magnitude but will act in opposite directions. Since the string is light and inextensible, it does not stretch, and the tension in the string is uniform throughout. This assumption allows us to consider the forces on each particle individually, while recognising that the tension will be the same for both particles, although acting in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When analysing the forces, we apply Newton's Second Law to each particle. For a particle of mass $m_1$, connected by a string to another particle of mass $m_2$, the tension $T$ in the string is one of the forces acting on $m_1$, and it opposes the motion of $m_1$ if the system is accelerating. Similarly, the tension acts in the opposite direction on $m_2$, resisting the motion of $m_2$ in its direction of travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the two particles are moving along a horizontal surface, or suspended vertically, additional forces such as friction, gravity, or normal contact forces may need to be considered. For horizontal motion on a smooth surface, we ignore friction, but on a rough surface, we introduce frictional forces, which oppose the direction of motion. For vertical motion (e.g. one particle suspended vertically while the other moves horizontally), gravity becomes a significant factor. The motion of the system is then affected by the gravitational force acting on each particle, with the tension in the string balancing part of this force.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, the particles share a common acceleration, since the string is inextensible. This common acceleration, $a$, can be found by analysing the forces acting on each particle and solving the system of equations that result from Newton's Second Law."

    "The introduction of a pulley can make the system seem more complicated, though the key thing to keep in mind is that a pulley simply changes the direction of the forces.
