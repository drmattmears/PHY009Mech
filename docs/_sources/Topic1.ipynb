    "There are many quantities you have heard about that can be fully described by some number and appropriate unit of measurement, such as mass (e.g. $10\\text{ g}$), distance between two points (e.g. $0.5\\text{ m}$) and time take for a kettle to boil (e.g. $120\\text{ s}$ or $2\\text{ mins}$). We call these types of quantities **scalars** and the size of the scalar is the **magnitude**. However there are other quantities that are not *completely* characterised by a single number with units.\n",

    "Consider the example where I told you that a person started half way between the entrance to the Hicks building and John's Van[^1], and that the person walked 4 meters. You do not have enough information to find their final position, and whether they walked towards getting a tasty treat or in some other direction. It is this word *direction* that is needed to provide the complete characterisation of **displacement**: the length, direction and units of the distance travelled allows you to know where the person is. We call this type of quantity a **vector**.\n",

If we have a particle that is starting at some point $O$ and moves to some final position $A$ then the displacement of the particle is denoted by $OA$. Given that a vector also has some direction to it we can represent this by introducing an arrow such that the vector describing the displacement from point $O$ to point $A$ is $\\overrightarrow{OA}$.\n",
