    "When we considered Newton's Second Law we stated that a non-zero net force will result in some acceleration (assuming the mass remains constant). Although this is true it is not the whole picture. It is entirely feasbile that a body experiencing some external force may not accelerate in a linear motion but instead begins to rotate. In this case we are concerning ourselves with the force acting in a direction perpendicular to the line connecting the pivot point and the point (or points) on the object where the force(s) are being applied. Let us consider a diagram of a bar of length $r$ with a fixed pivot point at one end and a force applied to the other end ({numref}`fig:C10_torque`).\n",
