    "## Rolling = translational + rotational\n",
    "So far we have learnt about systems moving with linear dynamics ([Lecture 1](Lecture1) to [Lecture 6](Lecture6) and systems that are rotating ([Lectures 7](Lecture7) and [8](Lecture8)). We can now turn our attention to the more complicated but also very common in real life systems that are rotating but also have translational motion. The most obvious system that we can examine is that of a circular object (ball or cylinder) rolling down a ramp. It is obviously rotating but also moves down the ramp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that we describe this rolling motion is by making heaving use of the centre of mass for the object. If we look at {numref}`fig:C9_roll1` we can see a silver disc rolling along a flat surface. The disc has two coloured markings, one at the centre of mass (in yellow) and one at the edge of the disc (in red). As you can see when the yellow and red positions are all displayed for the entire length the disc rolls along, the red position moves along a cycloid path from the flat surface to a maximum height equal to the diameter of the disc. The yellow centre of mass position however is a flat line parallel to the flat surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for a rolling disc the centre of mass is moving with linear motion only, which allows us to make connections between the rotational and linear kinematics.\n",

    "\n",
    "For an object that is rolling **without slipping** the linear distance travelled by the centre of mass is equal to the arc length between the first and last points on the edge of the disc. A way to visualise this is to imagine applying some wet paint to the edge of the disc. If you roll it along some distance $s$ then the paint transfered from the disc to the surface is the arc length on the disc. A schematic diagram is shown in {numref}`fig:C9_roll2`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a solid cylinder of mass $m$ and radius $r$ initially at rest on top of a ramp of height $h$ inclined by some angle $\\theta$ to the horizontal. The cylinder is given a gentle push and begins to roll down the ramp without slipping. We want to calculate the centre of mass velocity of the cylinder at the end of the ramp.\n",
    "\n",
    "To approach this we first assume that the system is isolated in that there is no energy lost from the mechanical system. This allows us to state that the change in gravitational potential energy must equal the total kinetic energy of the cylinder at the end of the ramp. In other words\n",

    "\n",
    "It is worth doing a sense check here. If we consider the more simple case of an object with mass $m$ sliding down a frictionless incline then the centre of mass velocity of the object will be $\\sqrt{2gh}$. This is larger than the centre of mass velocity for a rolling object which checks out with our intuition: if both the rolling and sliding object start from the same height they have the same potential energy, but while the sliding object converts this all to linear kinetic energy  the rolling object \"shares\" the energy between rotational and translational motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can take this further and calculate the time taken to roll down a ramp of length $L$, calculate the rotational velocity of the cylinder at the end of the ramp, and so on. You are now at the stage where you can start drawing on the different concepts and tools we have learned about in the previous chapters and make them work to solve whatever problem you have in front of you."

    "## Rolling Race\n",

    "\n",
    "Something else to note from equation {eq}`eq:V_CM_race` is the absence of any mass or radius terms. This means the centre of mass velocity of **all** solid cylinders, for example, will be the same regardless of how large or heavy they are. It **only** depends on the shape distribution quanitifed by $c$."
