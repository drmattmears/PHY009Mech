    "\n",
    "We are all aware by now that acceleration is a vector, so when we are dealing with circular and rotational systems we need to be mindful that the acceleration will be constantly changing even if the rotational speed remains constant. This is because the direction of the velocity vector is constantly changing around the circular path. This is shown in part a of {numref}`fig:C7_centri_accel` where we are imagining a particle moving in a circular path of radius $r$ with some constant rotational speed and no external forces acting on the system.\n",

If we now recall that the velocity vectors are at a tangent to the radius vector to the body we can see that the two triangles constructed in {numref}`fig:C7_centri_accel`b and c are similar triangles - the radii and velocities both subtend the same angle $\\Delta\\theta$.

    "This acceleration is always directed towards the centre of the circle and is perpendicular to the velocity. It is the acceleration that acts to change the direction so that the body stays on a circular path - if this acceleration were to disappear the body would then move in a straight line along the tangent to the curve at the point where the acceleration stopped, and with a velocity equal to the tangential velocity. This expression for $a$ is probably familiar to you from you pre-University courses but now you have one way in which you can derive it from scratch. There are other methods you could use that are in different textbooks (each book seems to have their own method) but I personally find this the most simple and delightful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But wait!** We have already seen that an acceleration is the result of a force acting on the body in question. This allows us to define a **centripetal force** $F_r$ that acts to keep the body on a circular path, starting from Newton's Second law for a constant mass system, \n",

    "So we have shown that there needs to be this centripetal force acting to cause the centripetal acceleration. But what exactly **is** this force? The answer depends very much on the system that you are concerned with. For a planet orbiting a star the centripetal force acting on the planet is gravity, whereas in the Bohr model of the atom the electrostatic force acts to keep the electron orbiting the nucleus. We are going to come back to looking more at gravity in [Lecture 11](Lecture11) and I will leave electrostatic forces for your course next semester. But we can think of some simple everyday examples using the physics we have already covered in this course and before."

Now we are going to rethink our ball on a string experiment but this time we will swing the ball around such that the circular path is in the vertical plane only. In this setup the tangential velocity is not constant because the components of force due to gravity vary depending on the position in the circular path.

However if we were to jump straight in a try to define this in terms of Cartesian coordinates (i.e. the typical $(x,y)$ system) then we immediately see the model is going to be complicated. The ball is moving in a circular path so if we make a change in $x$ then there will also be a change in $y$, but it is much easier if we can have two orthogonal parameters that vary independently.\n",

    "This is where we can make use of the coordinate systems you have seen in your maths courses. Instead of expressing the position of the ball with an $(x,y)$ coordinate we can instead use the radius and angle of the ball, $(r,\\theta)$. The unit vectors of these two parameters are perpendicular and so meet our orthogonality requirement, and we can also change one without changing the other. Awesome.\n",
