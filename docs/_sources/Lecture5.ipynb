    "There are some limitations to this model though. It assumes that as the velocity increased more and more the height will also increase more and more. However when we think about the physical system itself we can see that the height is limited between $0\\leq h \\leq 2L$ where $L$ is the length of the rope from which the block is suspended. This value of $2L$ corresponds to the bullet + block being at the top of the circle traced out by the swing of the system. It is sometimes easier to express the swing in terms of angle rather than change in height of the block, which is something for you to try."
