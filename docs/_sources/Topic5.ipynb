    "## Angular acceleration and forces\n",
    "\n",
    "We are all aware by now that acceleration is a vector, so when we are dealing with circular and rotational systems we need to be mindful that the acceleration will be constantly changing even if the rotational speed remains constant. This is because the direction of the velocity vector is constantly changing around the circular path. This is shown in part a of {numref}`fig:C7_centri_accel` where we are imagining a particle moving in a circular path of radius $r$ with some constant rotational speed and no external forces acting on the system.\n",

    "This acceleration is always directed towards the centre of the circle and is perpendicular to the velocity. It is the acceleration that acts to change the direction so that the body stays on a circular path - if this acceleration were to disappear the body would then move in a straight line along the tangent to the curve at the point where the acceleration stopped, and with a velocity equal to the tangential velocity. This expression for $a$ is probably familiar to you from you pre-University courses but now you have one way in which you can derive it from scratch. There are other methods you could use that are in different textbooks (each book seems to have their own method) but I personally find this the most simple and delightful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But wait!** We have already seen that an acceleration is the result of a force acting on the body in question. This allows us to define a **centripetal force** $F_r$ that acts to keep the body on a circular path, starting from Newton's Second law for a constant mass system, \n",

    "So we have shown that there needs to be this centripetal force acting to cause the centripetal acceleration. But what exactly **is** this force? The answer depends very much on the system that you are concerned with. For a planet orbiting a star the centripetal force acting on the planet is gravity, whereas in the Bohr model of the atom the electrostatic force acts to keep the electron orbiting the nucleus. "

    "## Non-uniform circular motion\n",
    "In all of the examples we have examined previously the circular path traced out by the moving body has been parallel to the horizontal, and consequently the tangential (and therefore angular) velocity is constant. Now we are going to rethink our ball on a string experiment but this time we will swing the ball around such that the circular path is in the vertical plane only. In this setup the tangential velocity is not constant because the components of force due to gravity vary depending on the position in the circular path. Take a look at {numref}`fig:C7_vert` showing a ball of mass $m$ moving in a clockwise circle of radius $r$ in the vertical plane.\n",

    "Once again we need to consider the two components of the different forces acting on our system. However if we were to jump straight in a try to define this in terms of Cartesian coordinates (i.e. the typical $(x,y)$ system) then we immediately see the model is going to be complicated. The ball is moving in a circular path so if we make a change in $x$ then there will also be a change in $y$, but it is much easier if we can have two orthogonal parameters that vary independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we can make use of the coordinate systems you have seen in your maths courses. Instead of expressing the position of the ball with an $(x,y)$ coordinate we can instead use the radius and angle of the ball, $(r,\\theta)$. The unit vectors of these two parameters are perpendicular and so meet our orthogonality requirement, and we can also change one without changing the other. Awesome.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we want to consider the **radial** and **tangential** components of the forces acting on our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with the tangential (i.e. the ones acting in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}}$ direction) components. We have the tangential component of gravity which we can equate, using Newton's Second Law, to the net tangential force.\n",

    "Next we move onto considering the radial forces. We know that the total sum of the forces is the centripetal force which in this case equals the tension in the string $T$ minus the radial component of gravity. The minus here is because the component from gravity is acting outwards and our centripetal force and the tension are acting inwards. This gives\n",

This is what we expect because gravity is acting downward whereas tension is acting completely upwards. If I were to define $\\theta=0$ at the top of the path then I would need to change the minus sign in equation {eq}`eq:C7_vert1` to a plus, but personally I find this means the physical interpretation of what the equation is describing becomes less self evident."
