    "Energy is, at best, strange. As a concept it perhaps the most far-reaching in terms of applicability but is also one of the most difficult to define completely and succinctly.

    "We now move away from the elastic condition that has by definition the requirement that the total kinetic energy in conserved. In an inelastic collision the total kinetic energy is not conserved which means some of the initial energy is 'lost' during the collision. Although we could consider systems where a collision occurs and the two bodies move apart (i.e. considering the elastic case but with energy loss) this turns out to be somewhat complicated as we need to quantify the amount of energy lost. This is beyond what we need to do for this course so instead we will focus our attention on a specific case of inelastic collisions in which the two initially separate bodies stick together at and after the collision, and thus move as one body.\n",

    "Compared to the elastic case this situation is much easier to derive. We start again by stating the conservation of momentum equation {eq}`eq:C5_COM2` but we now have a single mass $M$ moving with velocity $v_f$ after the collision. Thus\n",
