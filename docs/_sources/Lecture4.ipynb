    "Energy is, at best, strange. As a concept it perhaps the most far-reaching in terms of applicability but is also one of the most difficult to define completely and succinctly. We explain it in terms of different units, with different equations and models, and try to use general defining statements such as energy being something we 'pay' in order to get things done. One particular attempt that I like is from A. P. French (1971) who claimed that\n",

    "Having a well-defined meaning of energy is less important and useful compared to how we consider the **transformation** of energy. We cannot define energy in general but we can and will make heavy use of the fact that it is **conserved**, a statement that we will accept at face value.[^Noether]\n",
    "[^Noether]: The first and perhaps most elegant general proof that energy, linear and angular momentum are conserved was published by Emmy Noether in 1918. She demonstrated that any physical system with differentiable symmetry **must** have corresponding conservation laws. Her work had extremely far reaching implications and set the foundations for much of the classical physics you will study, but the formal proof of Noether's Theorem is beyond the scope of this course.\n",

    "If we take the rather fluffy statement that energy is is paid to do something, then we can define the property \"work\" that quantifies how this paid energy transforms our system from one state to another. For the purposes of this course we will **only** be considering dynamical states - I leave any thermal work for the Thermal component of the module, and take the approach that any energy that is transformed into a non-dynamical form is \"lost\", though we will revisit this apparent paradox of energy being both conserved and lost in [the last section](sec:C4_lost)."

Be careful with this approach however because some curves may look like they have a clear minimum or maximum but that may not be the case if you zoom in a lot - the calculus approach is safer!\n",
