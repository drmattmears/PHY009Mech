    "The hardest part, and in my experience the part that usually causes some students to trip up, is recognising that having more than one dimension means we need to think about the orthogonal components for any vector quantities involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us pick apart the last part of the paragraph above. We saw in the [one dimensional elastic collision case](sec:C5_elastic) that we make use of both the conservation of energy and conservation of momentum to find the final velocities of the two impacting bodies. The two dimensional case uses exactly the same concepts but it is important to be aware that because momentum is a vector quantity we need to resolve it into the two orthogonal components and use conservation of momentum twice, once for each component, whereas energy is a scalar quantity so we can only use this principle once.\n",
    "\n",
    "A worked example will help clarify this and demonstrate the process of solving problems involving elastic collisions in two dimensions. In {numref}`fig:C6_collision` a body of mass $m_1$ is moving with velocity $v_{1i}$ along the $x$-axis. It collides with a stationary body of mass $m_2$. After the collision the first body moves with a new velocity $v_{1f}$ in a straight line at an angle $\\theta$ to the $x$-axis. Similarly the second body moves with velocity $v_{2f}$ at an angle $\\phi$ below the $x$-axis.\n",
